pip install openai python-dotenv

# Run the API test
python test_openai_key.py
```

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your GitHub Personal Access Token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_github_token_here
```

### Step 3: Launch the Frontend
```bash
# Open index.html in your browser
# Or use a simple server:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 4: Demo the Application

2. **Authentication**: Demo login (use any email/password)
3. **Dashboard**: Explore the semantic search interface
4. **Sample Searches**: Try "AI healthcare applications" or "sustainable technology"
5. **Analytics**: View the real-time dashboard

## 🧠 How Semantic Search Works

### Traditional Keyword Search vs. Semantic Search

**Traditional Search:**
- Query: "AI healthcare"
- Finds: Documents containing exact words "AI" and "healthcare"
- Problem: Misses "machine learning medicine" or "artificial intelligence medical"

**Semantic Search (Our Solution):**
- Query: "AI healthcare"
- Understands: Medical applications of artificial intelligence
- Finds: All relevant documents regardless of exact wording
- Magic: Uses vector embeddings to understand meaning

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Simplified semantic search process
def semantic_search(query, documents):
    # 1. Convert query to vector embedding
    query_embedding = get_embedding(query)
    
    # 2. Calculate similarity with all documents
    results = []
    for doc in documents:
        similarity = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, doc.embedding)
        results.append((doc, similarity))
    
    # 3. Sort by relevance and return
    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```
